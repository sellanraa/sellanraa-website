        <h2>who and where i am</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Connor Bell (b. 1979 in Oshkosh, WI USA). Right now I’m living in Beechmont, a beautiful neighborhood in south Louisville with two wonderful little dachshunds that bring so much joy to my life. I’m a passionate person and spend my time pursuing knowledge and creativity. My curiosity feels insatiable and being creative, primarily through music, is an outlet for all that can’t be expressed so easily in life. After all, words are only one way to communicate.
          <br><br>
          I’ll keep an archive of these little essays linked with my writing samples. I didn’t really intend this to be a blog, and it’s certainly not a regular update, but I do like that I can trace a bit of a line by looking these over. 
          <br><br>
          <b>25.01.01:</b>
          <img class="portrait" src="img/2024_summary.jpg" alt="2024 summary">
          <br><br>
          Another year with tremendous change. 
<br><br>
Very shortly after my holiday card update, my life blew up. Right as my previous job concluded abruptly and surprisingly, I decided as much as I cared for the gal I was seeing, I wasn’t in a place where I could meet her needs. I’ve spent a large chunk of this year trying to find stable work, which I found in an opportunity in Nashville. That has required me to live a more splintered life where half my time is living with my sister and her family there and half the time working remotely back here in Louisville. I knew this would be challenging for me and push me out of my comfort zone to join a bustling and, often, chaotic household. I’ve lived a very safe and controlled life. I think that has been a response to the chaos of being a teacher, then the wild world of COVID, and then perhaps the survival shell dealing with my divorce. So to shake things up was probably a good idea. It has been everything I could have hoped for and more. Of course, there are some bumps as my humor and approach to life is often different than what my nieces are used to, but I’ve been privileged to see a family that is healthier than what I often experienced and gotten to see my nieces grow and evolve on a more consistent day-to-day level. I get to see the challenges parents face on a day to day level and the wonderful parents my brother-in-law and sister are and I’ve gotten to spend more time with my step-dad as well. In the end, one of the greatest consequences of my divorce is the opportunity to become closer to my sister and her support and genuine and unconditional love has been much needed as I try to navigate all the messiness of what I thought life was and what it is now. 
<br><br>
Aside from that, I’ve continued to work on music as much as possible. A few releases spilled out this fall. Under my solo moniker, <a class="link" href="https://www.shedding.org/" target="_blank"><b>Shedding</b></a>, I shared a second volume of a series called “This Is My Horn”. The conceit: what if I treated the small synthesizer like a true physical, gestural, and immediate instrument and applied the same mindset to it that the solo and small group jazz luminaries do. They are, after all, my biggest musical inspirations the past few years. So how would Anthony Braxton, Wolfgang Fuchs, Abdul Wadud, Motoharu Yoshizawa, or a whole host of other talents treat the idea of a solo performance on synth? I’ll continue to try to figure that out. My friend <a class="link" href="https://aestheticcomplexity.wordpress.com" target="_blank"><b>Guy Birkin</b></a> did the artwork too, which I’ve found fun to engage with him on. 
<br><br>
I also released a collection of live recordings from my shows up north in the fall of 2023 employing the idea of truly playing a sampler of mostly single-cycle waveforms. Nothing sequenced on the step sequencer, no hitting play, truly something that felt like a live performance. My friend <a class="link" href="https://joshmason.info/" target="_blank"><b>Josh Mason</b></a> did the art and it’s called Flocking 23.
<br><br>
Finally, the band I’ve done with long-time pals decided on a name and shared our first release just a week or so ago. Joey, Ben, and I first played together in Parlour over 20 years ago, touring the east coast and south down to SXSW. We then briefly reconvened as just a trio in 2007 before life got in the way. All these years later, we started playing again as my life was crumbling and I think the feeling of collaborating with talented friends has been the balm that has kept me sane. Yes, there’s often frustration and friction as we’re all pulled in different places, but there’s nothing that can replace that energy of banging things out in a room. To be back to singing and playing guitar has been very gratifying too. So we decided to call ourselves <a class="link" href="https://workingmodels.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><b>Working Models</b></a>. Give it a listen. It's certainly way more normal than anything I've done otherwise over the last decade.
<br><br>
I hope you’ve all been well.

        <h2>url explained</h2>
        <p>Sellanraa is the name of Isak’s farm in Knut Hamsun’s “Growth of the Soil”. The story of Isak and his farm have become something of a guidepost in my life.
          <br><br>
          Of a patient, simple, and steady approach. Of accepting the uncontrollable. Of not being distracted by endless comparisons or thinking life is a race. Of embracing the process.
