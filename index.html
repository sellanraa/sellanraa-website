        <h2>who i am</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Connor Joseph Bell (b. 1979 in Oshkosh, WI USA). Right now I’m living in Beechmont, a beautiful neighborhood in south Louisville with two wonderful little dachshunds that bring so much joy to my life. I’m a passionate person and spend my time pursuing knowledge and creativity. My curiosity feels insatiable and being creative, primarily through music, is an outlet for all of that can’t be expressed so easily in life. After all, words are only one way to express oneself.
          <br><br>I taught American history at, arguably, the best school in the state of Kentucky for over twelve years before walking away in the fall of 2020. The psychic fatigue became too much. This was the result of an incredibly complex set of variables. Fundamentally, teaching is a challenging job. But, trying to teach norms in a time where it increasingly felt like those didn’t exist weighed heavily on me, and chipped away at my morale and mental health. There was an emboldened ugliness in the school community that increasingly made me feel alienated, particularly when I felt like there was no accountability from those in power. Finally, the global pandemic created new challenges that took away some very important things that allowed me to bring joy to my job and recharge my batteries within the community so that I could be the teacher I wanted to be. I was privileged enough, and had enough self-belief, to walk away from a job I felt no longer adequately supported me. I decided after over a decade of prioritizing my career, to prioritize my mental health. I’ve seen up close, all too often, what happens to people who ignore that.
          <br><br>The last two years have been challenging to say the least. I have struggled to find meaningful work and pivot into another fulfilling and difference-making career. I’ve taken this time to get healthier by becoming a jogger when the tai chi classes stopped due to COVID. I’ve dipped my toes into coding, like this website you’ve accessed. For almost a year, I had enjoyed work in a warehouse where I eventually became a bit of a problem solver serving as liaison across departments and with outside vendors while concurrently building documentation for software that the rest of the company in other cities would be learning. I was the only person in the city doing this work and that felt kind of cool. It was something new and I truly enjoyed building new relationships with a lot of wonderful new friends. Unfortunately, this coincided with my marriage dissolving, and however amicable, it was still devastating. Eventually, I was asked to give too much from the logistics position for how I was being compensated. Knowing this wasn’t a long-term position where I would be challenged, supported, stimulated, and make a difference in, I once again thought of Kenny Rogers’ great wisdom in “The Gambler” and decided to fold ‘em. I know walking away from jobs doesn’t ‘look good’ on paper, but I think spending over twelve years in one very demanding job speaks to my willingness to commit when the right opportunity presents itself. But I’m also one of those people that doesn’t believe a job defines you. 
          <br><br>So the time away from the classroom has been interesting. The universe has kicked me around a fair amount and I’m still standing. Maybe the challenge to pivot out of the classroom has been a message that the world of education is where I belong. Or maybe I just haven’t found a company that recognizes the highly transferable skills that teaching gives someone. Or maybe people don’t recognize that an advanced degree in history builds an incredibly broad and strong foundation. Or maybe I’m just not that good at selling myself because my ability has always been recognized until now without that need. Or maybe I haven’t gotten many opportunities when the algorithm doesn’t recognize nuance and humanity. Or maybe the global economy is awful and continues to decline as inequality and injustice is on the rise. As a teacher, I tried to discourage a simplistic understanding of our past, so I have to conclude that it’s some unpleasant cocktail of all of the above.
          <br><br>As I continue to seek the new normal in life after a tumultuous two years, I wanted to amend this little biography on my website to be a bit more current, but also to be a bit more personal. Our reality discourages vulnerability, and I think it’s so important to be deeply human as an act of resistance to the status quo. To resist the bland lowest common denominator types of messages that are optimized to garner the most ‘likes’ on the internet. Sometimes I’m labeled a pessimist, but I believe I’m an idealist at my core, and that’s why I’m so regularly disappointed. I see our potential as so much greater than the reality we’ve built. Further, I don’t think you could be a pessimist and commit your life to educating young people. So, even after these two years of personal turmoil that has coincided with an uptick in global chaos, I continue to believe I’ll find that new normal when someone recognizes that the person, and their complex story, counts more than how the algorithm defines them.

        <h2>url explained</h2>
        <p>Sellanraa is the name of Isak’s farm in Knut Hamsun’s “Growth of the Soil”. The story of Isak and his farm have become something of a guidepost in my life.
          <br><br>
          Of a patient, simple, and steady approach. Of accepting the uncontrollable. Of not being distracted by endless comparisons or thinking life is a race. Of embracing the process.
