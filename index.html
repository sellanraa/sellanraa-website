<h1>About</h1>
<p>Sellanraa is the name of Isak’s farm in Knut Hamsun’s novel “Growth of the Soil”. The story of Isak and his farm have become something of a guidepost in my life. 

<br><br>A patient, simple, and steady approach to life. Of letting things unfold as they will. Of accepting the uncontrollable. Of not being distracted by the rat race and comparisons. Of embracing the process.
