        <p>
          My name is Connor Bell (b. 1979 in Oshkosh, WI USA). Right now I’m living in Beechmont, a beautiful neighborhood in south Louisville with two wonderful little dachshunds that bring so much joy to my life. I’m a passionate person and spend my time pursuing knowledge and creativity. My curiosity feels insatiable and being creative, primarily through music, is an outlet for all that can’t be expressed so easily in life. After all, words are only one way to communicate.
          <br><br>
          I’ll keep an archive of these little essays linked with my writing samples. I didn’t really intend this to be a blog, and it’s certainly not a regular update, but I do like that I can trace a bit of a line by looking these over. 
          <br><br>

          <br>
          I hope everyone is doing well. Apologies for no card last year, but life was a bit hectic. You’ll understand why shortly, if you don’t already know.
          <br><br>
          To get the obvious out of the way, I buzzed my hair for the first time in many years. It was time to let go of whatever sadness was happening up top, at least for now. One of my nicknames in high school, when I had a buzz, was “Private Joker” (Full Metal Jacket, anyone?), so I’m content being back in that mode. When your hair gets to a certain level of being thin, there’s not much that can be done with it, so it felt like it was time to let go. I’ve never felt like a vain person, but thinning hair will test a man. :)
          <br><br>
          With that out of the way:
          <br><br>
          In August 2024 I took a contract job in Nashville thanks to the generosity of Alissa and Sam and the girls, who allowed me to stay with them every other week when I had to be onsite. I hoped it’d be a special opportunity to experience a very different reality than my normal quiet life and I was right. While it was exhausting and stressful at times, it was also really wonderful in all the ways you’d expect from a bustling and loving family. Between George living there and me, the uncle with his two zany dogs crashing, my joke is that it was basically an 80s sitcom come to life. I hope they felt similarly positive about the experience of putting up with me so much more than normal. Thankfully, the job was great too. The workplace had a really positive and energetic atmosphere and the teamwork and chemistry was off the charts. It was a great community full of good folks. I couldn’t help but think ‘hey, I’m doing it, I’m a technical writer and doing really strong work’. I even received a performance award nomination from the product owner, which felt like important validation that this is all the right career path for me. So in February, when they wanted me to extend my contract a little longer for a second time, I declined. There was some small hope of getting a job offer, but Nashville is sort of dumb (there’s obviously nuance there I’m not bothering to explain, but it’s an expensive and overhyped city) and I felt like I had imposed on my family long enough without any real long-term clarity from the job. Further, the back and forth was pretty tiring. Ever since, unfortunately I’ve been unemployed. I spend time refining the resume, doing my best to network authentically, and hunt for jobs five days a week. I’ve had many great conversations but I’m just not quite finding the right fit. Now, it has quieted down, presumably as businesses formulate 2026 plans and budgets. I’m optimistic that things will pick back up in the new year. I fear if I get some random crummy (read: unfulfilling and/or demoralizing) job, I’d be so exhausted that continuing to search for something wouldn’t happen, so I’m trying to hold firm in my approach. 
          <br><br>
          In hindsight, perhaps I should’ve extended that contract instead of declining their request to stay with them. I suppose I have too much self-belief for this awful job market. There’s been so much tumult in this regard, it’s sort of become the new normal and I’m largely at peace with it. What becomes tricky is that it is hard to really settle into life when you’re looking for work that could require relocating suddenly. It’s challenging trying to be present with one foot out the door. I suppose I feel a bit disconnected from the local community, as a result. Further, how can I really date while being unemployed? All of that is to say it’s been a quiet and simple stretch of life.
          <br><br>
          Aside from the job hunt, I’m mostly focused on being healthy and pursuing artistic challenges and intellectual growth without much distraction aside from the pups needing a good routine.
          <br><br>
          The weens are doing well. Ruby turned 12 recently and she still hasn’t had a single tooth pulled. The annual dentals, though expensive, are proving worth it. The vet joked that normally by this age, dachshunds don’t have any teeth left, so to not have a single one pulled feels like a major win. Her hearing does seem to be fading, but it’s less selective than Dagny’s - who has settled into largely ruling the household with a brash puppy energy. She sinks into a chair overlooking the front and pulls a lengthy guard shift every day. Otherwise, they continue to smell and pee on everything. Business as usual.
          <br><br>
          I’ve been really ramping up my exercise figuring I have no excuse not to focus on physical health with the time I have. A year or two ago, when I finally got COVID, I totally lost steam with my kettlebell workouts and I’m gradually working those back in six days a week. More importantly, my year-end running recap in 2024 was pathetic, so I’ve really committed to trying to run three 5Ks a week (9.3 miles total) and have almost managed to do that if not for the weather and a few issues that required me to pause briefly. Still, I’ll surely hit 460 miles and three 5Ks/week is 484 miles, so that’s pretty close. The coolest moment was hitting 6.2 miles one morning this summer when I just felt like pushing it a bit. All in all, not bad for someone who never ran until his early 40s. Something to be proud of, for sure, and apparently I lost 10 pounds in the process, which I discovered after being weighed at my annual physical recently.
          <br><br>
          Otherwise, music is music - always working. Reading is reading - always reading. I have had the Criterion Channel for quite awhile when I decided to not re-up MLBtv, so I’ve been watching a lot of old and new foreign films among others. It’s been a great resource for exploring. Of course, I caved later in the season on the baseball package when the Brewers just kept winning. Sad to see them play so poorly to end the season against the gross Goliath that is the LA Dodgers. 
          <br><br>
          If I could recommend one book and one movie from the past year or so:
          <br><br>
          Jon Fosse's “Septology” was a really beautiful and meditative book and, perhaps in a similarly poignant and contemplative spirit, Wim Wenders’ newest movie “Perfect Days” is worth viewing. It’s rare that a movie sticks with me like this one has.
          <br><br>
          In that more contemplative mode:
          <br><br>
          I don’t think I’ve lived anywhere as long in my life as where I am. All of that is to say: I love this house and it very much is home. If the time comes to move, I’ll definitely be bummed on some level. It is a wonderful place for me and my little clan of pups.
          <br><br>
          My uncle, my mom’s only brother, passed away late this summer. Reflecting on loss and the complexity of  family is always an interesting process as I organized old family photos and such. It’s weird how I’m one of the last here in Louisville after being so desperate to escape and return north all my life.
          <br><br>
          I wrapped my last update from 2023 with the ‘life is a highway’ wisdom from Tom Cochrane, but damned if it doesn’t remain applicable. If only I could figure out a way to tie it all back to the wisdom of Kenny Rogers ‘The Gambler’, because that contains deep truths that I reflect on more routinely. I suppose Cochrane only comes up when you zoom out and try to summarize the wild ride of life in these updates.

        <h2>url explained</h2>
        <p>Sellanraa is the name of Isak’s farm in Knut Hamsun’s “Growth of the Soil”. The story of Isak settling down and patiently building his farmstead have become something of a guidepost in my life.
          <br><br>
          Of a patient, simple, and steady approach. Of accepting the uncontrollable. Of not being distracted by endless comparisons or thinking life is a race. Of embracing the process.
