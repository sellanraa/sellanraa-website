**This page is meant to serve as a splash page for a few different things.**

First, a quick introduction to who I am, share my CV, and offer some writing samples. Maybe eventually I'll create a markdown blog, but I'm not sure I'm that committed to that sort of pursuit.

Second, a page for my dogs, because some of my friends enjoy them.

Finally, eventually I hope to integrate my music project into this domain, but right now it's still over on WordPress and my vision for that is beyond what I can pull off myself.


**Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements**

First, I worked on the burger menu.

I've also used flexbox and grid to aid with formatting for various screen sized.

__I'm not sure I'll get to accessibility, but that is my goal this week__

As far as Javascript, I've inserted a random image loader for the main/bio page (index.html) and __I'm hoping to integrate the option to enlarge photos as well__
