**Intro**

This page is meant to serve as a splash page for a few different things.

First, a quick introduction to who I am, share my CV, and offer some writing samples. Maybe eventually I'll create a markdown blog, but I'm not sure I'm that committed to that sort of pursuit.

Second, a page for my dogs, because some of my friends enjoy them.

One question I couldn't resolve was how to somehow constrain the one portrait picture of the dog, Coco, on my fosters page, when basically every other photo is more of a landscape layout. I just accepted this a a minor layout flaw.

Finally, eventually I hope to integrate my music project into this domain, but right now it's still over on WordPress and my vision for that is beyond what I can pull off myself.


**Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements**

First, I worked on the burger menu.

I've also used flexbox and grid to aid with formatting for various screen sized.

I'm not sure I'll get to accessibility, but that is my goal this week__

As far as Javascript, I've inserted a random image loader for the main/bio page (index.html) and I've integrated the option to enlarge ween photos as well on each of the dog pages.
