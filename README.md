1. A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is

* This page will essentially serve as an overview bio page. I hope to eventually integrate a markdown blog and redesign my music site that is currently designed on WordPress and integrate it directly into this URL. That will have to wait as I have specific and lofty ideas for how that should be done.
* Otherwise, it should be pretty self-explanatory. 

2. Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements
* CSS Features: burger menu, flexbox AND grid
* JavaScript Features: random picture of me to load from an array on index.html and 

3. If needed, any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project

4. The readme should be called readme.md or readme.txt and located in the top level of your project folder so that GitHub automatically displays it when viewing your project on GitHub
